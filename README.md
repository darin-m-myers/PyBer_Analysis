# :car: PyBer Analysis :car:
Ride sharing visualizations using Python and Pandas.

## Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to compare various metrics concerning the total rides, drivers, and fares as well as average fares per ride and driver for each of the three business areas, Urban, Suburban, and Rural. This summary data will allow for analysis into the makeup of the customer base in each area and trending over time for the total fares. Several recommendations complete this analysis and provide some possible action items or areas to continue investigation.

## Results
### From Image 1.1 - PyBer Summary
1. The *total rides* in 2019 were significantly higher for Urban areas (1,625) than the other two areas, with Suburban at 625, and Rural coming in last with only 125 total rides.
2. The *total drivers* in Urban areas (2,405) again eclipsed the other two areas, with Rural again with low numbers of only 78 drivers.
3. The *total fares* continued to follow this trend with Urban collecting $39,854.38, Suburban in the middle with $19,356.33, and Rural with only $4,327.93.
4. Despite the overall trend of the raw totals, the *average fare per ride* was highest in Rural areas ($34.62) which is over 10 times the average in Urban areas ($24.53). The Suburban area ($24.52) was also higher than Urban by more than $6 per ride.
5. The *average fare per driver* mirrors the *average fare per ride* with Rural again on top with $55.49 dollars, Suburban at $39.50, and Urban only showing $16.57 per driver.

### From Image 1.2 - Total Fare by City Type
1. From the chart, we can see that Urban collected higher fares throughout the entire period of months, with Suburban collecting more fares than Rural throughout. 
2. There appears to be a jump in fares collected in the second half of February.
3. There is a slight upward trend in the Urban and Suburban areas overall.
4. Though the Rural areas fluctuated, they remained fairly even overall.
5. Suburban picked up a bit in the second half of April; this could be a new shift, or just a temporary spike. More data into later months of 2019 will be needed to follow this trend.

### Summary
1. Urban areas, by far, generate the greatest revenue. Though this is the case, it is driven mostly by volume of fares and not by the size of the fares. Competition for fares in Urban areas is fierce and is already pretty saturated with companies and drivers. I would propose that we work to add some additional differentiators for our Urban service to try and set us apart from the other options. Perhaps offering a monthly fee to get priority access, or loyalty discounts to get passengers to use Pyber exclusively.
2. Suburban areas seem to be trending upward in the last half of May. We should continue to monitor this trend, and perhaps commit more resources to help maintain this growth.
3. Higher fares are present in the Rural areas. 10 times higher than the fares in Urban areas. The overall volume of rides here is very small, but the length is longer. If we invest more marketing or some first time discounts in the area, perhaps we can increase the engagement of the overall rural population to tap into the higher rates in the area over time.
